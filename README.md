# election_survey

This repo contains code used to simulate data for a survey that I designed to gather insight on how voters in the University-Rosedale district would vote if an election were to be held today. The survey was designed using Qualtrics and can be found at: tinyurl.com/PetitPoll, 

The data for the survey responses was simulated and analyzed as an academic exercise. 

The repo is organized in the following way:

## Inputs 
- images used in the final report - survey screenshots, maps, etc.

## Scripts
- data_simulation.R - the script used to simulate data 

## Outputs 
- Polling Report.Rmd and Polling-Report.pdf - the final report
